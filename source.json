It is the successor of the former FridaCodeManager project, which was deprecated in favor of Nyxian, because FridaCodeManager requires a jailbreak to work while Nyxian does not.",

While that daemons and nyxian doesnt have that entitlement set in its entitlement layer, because Nyxian shall not inherit its entitlements to the child process lol. Its a curse of unbinding entitlement, when a process has it all process it spawns have the same entitlements as it self 1:1.",
